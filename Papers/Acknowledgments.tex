\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to sincerely thank Professor Harry J. Paarsch for his guidance throughout this project and the graduate program as a whole. His mentorship, dedication to helping us grow into capable professionals, and focus on preparing us for real-world challenges have been truly impactful. I am grateful for the time, effort and care that he put into helping us think critically, work responsibly, and approach problems with confidence.

I also want to express my appreciation to Professors Michael Tseng, Majid Mahzoon, and Alexander Mantzaris for the skills and knowledge they shared with us throughout the program. Their thoughtful teaching and commitment to our development provided the foundation I needed for this work. I am also grateful to Professor Joshua Eubanks for his support and guidance along the way.

This journey would not have been the same without the collaboration and support of my fellow students. I am grateful to Hope Mullins, Jonathan Lewis, Trey Abrahams, Fyad Yasin, Evan Graetz, Sabrina Koshedub-Colaco, Guilia Mancini, Anurag Elluru, Pooja, Kristian Nunez, Daimel Portes, and Marc Secasan. It has been a privilege to learn and grow alongside such  dedicated and thoughtful individuals, and I am truly thankful for the sense of community we shared.
